# Author-Attribution
This repository involves cleaning text data from Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice e-book and Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre: An Autobiography e-book, then using a machine learning model to predict which author a sentence belongs to using Logistic Regression. Additionally, an accuracy analysis of the model was also performed.

# Subjects

- Cleaning and tokenizing text data and manipulating the data for Logistic Regression Model.
- Building ML model and predicting whether the randomly chosen sentence belongs to Austen or Bronte.
- Analyzing confusion matrix and accuracy of model.

  # Libraries Used

  - Data Manipulating: Numpy, Pandas, Requests, Re, Io, gensim.models, Nltk
  - Machine Learning: Sklearn
  - Analysis Part: Pandas, Matplotlib
